## IF WAITING ON US TO UPLOAD THE SCRIPT FILE WAIT WE ARE DEVELOPING IT BUT WE ARE JUST SETTING UP THE GITHUB RESPORITIE! ITS NEARLY DONE

# Evil-Shock Description 
Evil-Shock is a powerful tool made to exploit Shellshock, what's special with Evil-Shock is that it doesn't base his attacks on one parameter, example another tool might inject a simple "echo Vulnerable" and see if the server executes that. In many case the server wont execute that command but can execute another command ;)
Evil-Shock will find the perfect command also known as Injection Point and then execute further commands to gain remote access via the injection point, so far for the first version Evil-Shock can check for 4 different Injection Point:
<p>
1 - NSLookup
</p>
<p>
2 - Echo
</p>
<p>
3 - LS
</p>
<p>
4 - Ping
</p>

In further version more injections points will be added.
